\section{General Implementation Details}
%======================================================


This section gives an overview on how this code works.
To read about how to use the code, see the \texttt{/README.md} file.



\subsection{How the program works}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	All the source files are in the \texttt{/program/src/} directory.
	
	\item 	The main program files are \texttt{/program/src/main.c} if you want to use the code as a hydro/hyperbolic conservation law solver, or \texttt{/program/src/main-riemann.c} if you want to use the code as a Riemann solver.
	
	\item 	The program starts off by reading in the initial conditions (IC) file and the parameter file, which are both required command line arguments when executing the program.
			All functions related to reading and writing files are in \texttt{/program/src/io.c}
	
	\item 	Then a few checks are done to make sure no contradictory or missing parameters are given, and the grid on which the code will work on is initialized, as well as some global variables like the step number and current in-code time.
	
	\item 	There are two global variables used throughout the code:
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	\texttt{ struct params param}: A parameter struct (defined in \texttt{/program/src/params.h}) that stores global parameters that are useful to have everywhere throughout the code (even if it isn't optimal coding practice...)
					All parameter related functions are in \texttt{/program/src/params.c}.
			
			\item 	\texttt{ struct cell* grid} or \texttt{struct cell** grid}, depending on whether you run the code in 1D or 2D, respectively.
					It's an array of \texttt{struct cell}, defined in \texttt{/program/src/cell.h}, which is meant to store all cell related quantities: primitive states, \texttt{prim}, as  \texttt{struct pstate}, and conserved states, \texttt{cons}, as \texttt{struct cstate}.
					Furthermore they have \texttt{struct pstate pflux} and \texttt{struct cstate cflux} to store fluxes of primitive and conserved variables.
					All cell/grid related functions are written in \texttt{/program/src/cell.c}.	
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item 	If the code is used as a hydro/conservation law solver: 
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	The main loop starts now:
			\item 	Advance the solver for a time step.
			\item 	Write output data if you need to (when to dump output is specified in the parameter file).
					All functions related to reading and writing files are in \texttt{/program/src/io.c}
			\item 	Write a message to the screen after the time step is done. 
					This includes the current step number, in-code time, the ratio of initial mass to the current mass on the entire grid, and the wall-clock time that the step needed to finish.
		\end{itemize}

	\item 	If the code is used as a Riemann solver: 
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	Only do a loop over all cells and solve the Riemann problem given by the IC at the cell's position at given time $t$.
					Some functions for the Riemann problem that are used by all implemented Riemann solvers are given in \texttt{/program/src/riemann.h} and \texttt{/program/src/riemann.c}.
					When a specific Riemann solver is set, \texttt{/program/src/riemann.h} includes that file from the directory \texttt{/program/src/riemann/}. 
					The file names in that directory should be obvious.
			
			\item 	Write output data. 
					All functions related to reading and writing files are in \texttt{/program/src/io.c}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
