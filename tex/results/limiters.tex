	{The effect of different slope limiters on linear advection, applied to piecewise linear advection}




\begin{itemize}

	\item All limiters except superbee still contain diffusion. You can't get rid of it entirely, but we got rid of the oscillations.
	
	\item The minmod resembles the solution of the piecewise constant advection, but pay attention that this is at much later times!
	
	\item Some limiters flatten continuous maxima. Van leer, then MC, then superbee in order of ascending ``flattening''
	
	\item It's as if superbee tries to produce jump discontinuities
	
	\item For order of convergence study, see figs. \ref{fig:advection-convergence-dx-gaussian} - \ref{fig:advection-convergence-CFL-step}, and discussion in section \ref{chap:advection-conclusions}.

\end{itemize}
