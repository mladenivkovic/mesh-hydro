\subsection{Conclusions}
%==============================================================


\begin{itemize}

	\item 	The WAF method without limiters, fig. \ref{fig:WAF-no-limiter}, gives terrible results.
			In fact, in a lot of cases the oscillations would grow too strong and the code would crash.

	\item 	Similar to the piecewise linear advection, the drops around jump discontinuities are now much sharper, i.e. less diffusive, when limiters are applied.
			Compare fig. \ref{fig:WAF-riemann-const} to fig. \ref{fig:godunov-4}.

	\item 	The choice of the Riemann solver has no noticeable effect on the solution. 
			See fig. \ref{fig:WAF-riemann-const}.
	
	\item 	The effect of the limiter is comparable to how they behave on linear advection. 
			See fig. \ref{fig:WAF-limiter-const-1} - \ref{fig:WAF-limiter-const-4}.


	\item 	The trouble with vacuum that Godunov's method already had persists.
			I couldn't find literature on how to deal with vacuum using the WAF method, so I made up my own.
			For small time steps, it ``works'', as in it doesn't crash, and gives better results than the Godunov method if a left or a right state is vacuum.
			But for vacuum generating conditions, the velocity in the middle develops massive spikes earlier than Godunov's method;
			Compare figs. \ref{fig:waf-vacuum-generating-1} and \ref{fig:waf-vacuum-generating-2} to \ref{fig:godunov-vacuum-generating-2}.
			
			

	\item \textbf{Order of Convergence}
	
		\begin{itemize}
			
			\item 	Looking at the time step dependence (fig. \ref{fig:waf-convergence-dt}), it's absolutely terrible.
					I'm not sure why, but it is comparable to the results of WAF advection, fig. \ref{fig:advection-WAF-convergence-dt-step}. 
					
			\item 	For the cell width dependence (fig. \ref{fig:godunov-convergence-dx}), we get a remarkable slope of $\approx 1$ for all solvers.

			
			\item 	For the $C_{cfl}$ dependence, it again doesn't follow the expected slope of the $0.5$ power law that we get for small $\Delta t$.
					Similarly to the WAF advection (fig. \ref{fig:advection-WAF-convergence-CFL-step}) however, it gets close to a power law (straight line in log space) already at ``high'' $C_{CFL} \approx 0.7$, which is telling us that the diffusion which is $\propto (1 - C_{CFL})$ for first order methods is strongly reduced.
