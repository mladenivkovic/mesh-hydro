\section{Advection}


What is implemented is the equation

\begin{equation}
    \DELDT{\U} + \V \cdot \DELDVECX{\U} = 0
\end{equation}


where we assume that the velocity $\V$ is constant. 
Therefore, the fluid velocity is never updated, but kept identical to the initial conditions.

You can change that behaviour by removing the \verb|ADVECTION_KEEP_VELOCITY_CONSTANT| macro definition in \verb|defines.h|
