Coverage
========================


Run a coverage test and compile a detailed html doc
It's made to work with gcc and gcovr.
You can get gcovr via pip, i.e. pip install gcovr.
You need gcovr >= 4.2 as you need json output that can
be concatenated later.

This test takes quite a while to run. So be patient :)
